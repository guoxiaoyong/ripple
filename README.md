# LeeKweed

LeeKweed is a small program that creates water ripple effect on an image. This is done by solving a two-dimensional wave equation to get the position of water surface, then consider the refraction of light on water surface.

The method I used in this program to solve the wave equation is very computational expensive. There are better ways to do it.
